# Diderot Checker

In CMU's 15-251, it was required to answer a poll at some point during the class. This script simply loads the page in the background and will tell you when Diderot has a poll that needs answering. Just keep $IP/251.php in the background, where $IP is the IP address of whatever webserver this code is running on.

A dubious program indeed. But, it did what it needed to do. Those points didn't really matter at the end of the day, it seems.
